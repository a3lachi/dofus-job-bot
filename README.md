# Project description

This is a bot for the game Dofus that automates various tasks and provides map awareness. The bot is designed to work with the desktop version of the game and uses various techniques to interact with the game's interface, including image recognition, window activation, and keyboard and mouse input.
  
The bot includes several modules that can be used independently or in combination to achieve different goals. Some of the modules available include:  

### -  For the moment being:

**Harvesting bot**: This module automates harvesting resources from various locations in the game world. It can detect resource nodes using image recognition and then navigate to them, harvest them, and deposit the resources in a storage container.

### - Future projects: 

**Combat bot**: This module automates combat with monsters in the game. It can detect monsters using image recognition, select spells or attacks to use, and move around the game world to avoid attacks.

**Fishing bot**: This module automates fishing in various locations in the game world. It can detect fishing spots using image recognition and then cast and reel in the fishing line to catch fish.

The bot is designed to be customizable and extensible, and new modules can be easily added to support additional tasks or game features.
